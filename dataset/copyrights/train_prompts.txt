made of plastic
in origami style
watching something from a distance
looking up curiously
made of metal
looking into a mirror
as a hologram
made of clay
as a charcoal drawing
made of wood
as a paper cutout
sitting by a waterfall
on a hot summer day
yawning sleepily
running across a grassy field
walking through a desert
smiling softly
basking in the sun
walking through autumn leaves
with armor of gold
