in a business suit
in Times Square at night
under a spotlight
on a bright sunny day
smiling gently at the camera
crying softly
in a greenhouse filled with plants
in athletic wear with a gym bag
walking in the street
walking through a forest
sitting on a bench
with neon lights reflecting on their face
sitting on a chair
in a busy city street
with a serious expression
on a snowy street at night
sitting on the floor
looking directly at the viewer
with a tear running down their cheek
on stage under bright lights
in a colorful marketplace
wearing a turtleneck 
dressed in winter clothes with a scarf
under soft studio lighting
laughing with joy
