sleeping peacefully
watching something from a distance
as a paper cutout
sitting by a waterfall
exploring a cave
running across a grassy field
resting under a tree
trapped in a crystal
in a snowy forest
with armor of gold
standing on a mountain cliff
walking through a desert
as a robot
made of wood
as a cartoon character
in graffiti style
made of metal
standing next to a person
basking in the sun
lying in a forest clearing
looking into a mirror
smiling softly
walking in the jungle
walking through a foggy forest
made of stone
yawning sleepily
as a hologram
walking on a dirt road
on a hot summer day
in watercolor on textured paper
